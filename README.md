# REACT GITHUB USER CARD

- [ ] This project starts by showing my github information, and lets you search up any github username and it will display their information in the same format!

### FOR LOCAL HOSTING:

- [ ] Make sure you install dependencies! _npm install/yarn install_
- [ ] _This uses the public REST github API to grab user information, no specific token is used or needed_

## ABOUT:

- [ ] For this project I used styled components primarily to style up the app.
- [ ] Was made primarily just to test my ability to set up and maintain state with class components
